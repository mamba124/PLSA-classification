# PLSA-classification

This repository consists of .py scripts where there are implemented the necessary steps for unsupervised learning model.

I tried to implement the PLSA algorithm using this (http://machinelearning.ru/wiki/images/1/1f/Voron14aist.pdf) paper.

All the files must be launched in the same kernel.
